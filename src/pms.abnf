; === Naming Scheme ===
;  * Normal entities are named as follows.
;     * Top level entities conclude with the suffix '-name'
;     * Components of those entities generally include a further suffix,
;       for instance '-name-first-char'
;     * Specific, terminal entities are named uniquely.
;  * Ontological entities are named differently.
;     * Top level ontological categories are named using the suffix '-types'
;       (to avoid collision with the 'category' entity within PMS).
;     * Other ontological category names include the string '-type-'.
